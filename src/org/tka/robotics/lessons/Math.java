        Here in Java mathland, we have 5 different mathematical operators:
        +  addition
        -  subtraction
        *  multiplication
        /  division
        %  modulus

        Modulus is the one you may not have heard of. It gives the remainder after dividing two numbers
        Ex: 7 / 3 is 2 remainder 1.
        Therefore 7 % 3 = 1

        (Its useful for telling if something is even or odd cause x % 2 is always 0 for evens and 1 for odds)
