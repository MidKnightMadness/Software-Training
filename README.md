# Software Training
Goals:
 * Introduce members to Java - variables, math, methods, classes, DcMotor, Telemetry, and the FTC Docs
 * Introduce members to GitHub - pull, commit, push, conflict cycle

Notes:
We need a challenge for each part - variables, math, methods... One file for the lesson (which I’ve made examples for variables and math) and one file that outlines a challenge for them to use their new knowledge. It should be straightforward to mess up (something easy to forget).

Let me know if you’ve pulled and are working on it and push when you’re done so we don’t both work on the same lesson.
